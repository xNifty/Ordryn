# GoTodo

GoTodo is a self-hosted task manager built with Go, PostgreSQL, and HTMX. It focuses on simplicity and a pleasant experience: user accounts, per-user tasks, invite flow, role-based permissions, a responsive UI, and in-place HTMX interactions.

**Current version:** v0.15.1-beta

## Features

- User signup / login / logout with forgot-password flow
- Editable profile (display name, timezone, tasks-per-page preference)
- Per-user tasks: add, edit, duplicate, complete, delete, drag-and-drop reorder
- Projects with rename and delete; tags with create-on-type, rename, and delete
- Priority levels (None / Low / Medium / High) with optional sort-by-priority view
- Due dates with smart filters (today, overdue, this week, no date) and relative labels
- Starred tasks pinned above pagination
- Search with project, status, tag, and due-date filters
- Markdown task descriptions with truncated list view and expand-in-place
- Bulk actions: complete, delete, move project, add/remove tag, set priority
- CSV/JSON export and CSV import (auto-creates projects and tags)
- Task activity timeline in the edit sidebar
- Dashboard with overdue/today counts, completion charts, and streak tracking
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users (`?` for help)
- Invite-only registration and role-based permissions (admin, create invites)
- Admin panel: site settings, user management, global announcements
- Dark and light themes
- HTMX for partial page updates without full reloads

## Quick start

Requirements:

- Go 1.24+
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js + npm (for frontend asset builds)

1. Copy the example env file to `.env` and edit values:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=youruser
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=gotodo
SESSION_KEY=your-32-char-or-longer-secret-key!!
BASE_PATH=/         # optional
ASSET_VERSION=20251130  # optional; bump to force client cache refresh
```

2. Install frontend dependencies and build assets:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build:assets
```

3. Build and run:

```bash
go build -o gotodo main.go
./gotodo
```

Or run directly:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Open the app in your browser (default: http://localhost:8080).

## Frontend Assets

Pre-built minified CSS/JS are included (`internal/server/public/css/site.min.css`, `internal/server/public/js/site.min.js`) so a fresh clone works immediately.

After modifying frontend source:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build:assets
```

## Database

The app uses `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool`. Migrations run automatically on startup via `internal/storage/migrations.go`.

## Development

- Routes: `internal/server/server.go`
- Handlers: `internal/server/handlers`
- Templates: `internal/server/templates`
- Static assets: `internal/server/public`
- Roadmap: `docs/ROADMAP.md`

Run tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

No `.env` file is required for tests; a test session key is used automatically under `go test`.
