# Ordryn

Ordryn (formerly GoTodo) is a self-hosted task manager built with Go, PostgreSQL, Redis, and a Vue 3 SPA. It focuses on simplicity and a pleasant experience: user accounts, per-user tasks, invite flow, role-based permissions, and a JSON `/api/v2` for web and mobile clients (`/api/v1` remains as a compatibility alias).

Published versions: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SentientTD-Studios/Ordryn/releases).

## Features

- User signup / login / logout with forgot-password flow and optional TOTP MFA
- Editable profile (display name, timezone, tasks-per-page preference)
- Per-user tasks: add, edit, duplicate, complete, delete, drag-and-drop reorder
- Projects with rename, archive, and delete; tags with create-on-type, rename, recolor, and delete
- Kanban boards with custom statuses, estimates, claims, and named sprints (descriptions, date ranges, lock dates, and a board sprint switcher)
- Priority levels (None / Low / Medium / High) with optional sort-by-priority view
- Due dates with smart filters (today, overdue, this week, no date) and relative labels
- Search with project, status, tag, and due-date filters
- Markdown task descriptions with truncated list view and expand-in-place
- Task discussion comments with @-mentions of project members (notifies them) and #task links; authors and project owners can edit comments, with posted/edited timestamps and an admin restore log
- Bulk actions: complete, delete, move project, add/remove tag, set/clear due date, set priority, set kanban status, move sprint
- Undo delete (toast with up to 120 seconds to restore, preserves task IDs when possible)
- ICS calendar feed for due tasks; in-app calendar view; ICS import to sync due dates
- CSV import with preview/confirm; CSV/JSON export (auto-creates projects and tags on import)
- Task activity timeline in the edit sidebar
- Dashboard with overdue/today counts, completion charts, and streak tracking
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users (`?` for help)
- Invite-only registration and role-based permissions (admin, create invites)
- Admin panel: site settings, user management, global announcements, configurable image hosting (S3-compatible or local uploads)
- Dark and light themes
- Vue 3 SPA at the site root (or `BASE_PATH`, e.g. `/gotodo/`) over `/api/v2` (session cookie auth)
- Live updates over Server-Sent Events so shared projects and other tabs stay in sync without a refresh
- Drop-in **extensions** (`data/extensions/<id>/manifest.json`): outbound event hooks, custom fields, a sandboxed project panel, and scoped callback tokens for HTTP relays

## Extensions

Ordryn loads folders from `data/extensions/` (or `EXTENSIONS_DIR`) at startup. Each folder is one extension. Copy examples from `examples/extensions/` (or keep a local copy under `data/extensions/`), enable them in **Admin → Extensions**, then configure destinations on the project **Extensions** tab.

Bundled examples cover chat destinations (Discord, Slack, Teams, Google Chat, ntfy, generic webhook, email relay), focused hooks (due-dates including `task.due_soon`, comments + mentions, claimed, activity, lifecycle, join-requests), a personal **Mentions** ntfy destination, **Standup** (sandboxed daily check-in panel), **Retro** (kanban-tab retrospective using the document store), **Callback bot** (sandboxed panel, callback tokens, inbound `complete`/`set_field`), and custom fields (`severity`, `estimate`, `fields-demo` including `date` and `markdown`).

A `manifest.json` is the whole contract (`host_api` 1 or 2). No JavaScript or WASM plugin runtime: Ordryn delivers events to Discord, Slack, Teams, Google Chat, ntfy, or a generic HTTPS webhook, optionally serves a sandboxed HTML panel (including a kanban tab in host API 2), and can accept inbound actions.

### Identity

Optional fields help the directory look like a real product:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `author` | Display name (80 chars) |
| `homepage` | `http(s)` URL |
| `license` | Short SPDX-style label (64 chars) |
| `icon` | Image file in the extension folder, shown in Admin and project settings |

### Event hooks

Declare `hooks` with `on` (and optional `label`). The UI uses the label; templates and APIs still use the event name.

Task: `task.created`, `task.updated`, `task.deleted`, `task.commented`, `task.comment_edited`, `task.comment_deleted`, `task.comment_restored`, `task.reordered`, `task.claimed`, `task.unclaimed`, `task.due_changed`, `task.moved`, `task.project_changed`, `task.sprint_changed`, `task.tagged`, `task.overdue`, `task.mentioned`, `task.completed`, `task.reopened`, `task.due_soon` (due tomorrow), `task.archived`, `task.restored`, `task.status_changed`

Project / sprint / import: `project.created`, `project.updated`, `project.deleted`, `project.archived`, `project.restored`, `project.member_joined`, `project.member_left`, `project.member_role_changed`, `project.invite_sent`, `project.invite_declined`, `sprint.created`, `sprint.updated`, `sprint.deleted`, `sprint.started`, `sprint.ended`, `import.completed`

Site (Admin): `join.request`, `join.approved`, `join.denied`

Triggers may include `*` to match every **declared** hook. Empty project/member trigger lists still mean none. `templates["*"]` is the default message when an event has no specific template.

SSE still uses `task.updated` / `project.updated` / `task.commented` so the UI refreshes. Outbound hooks use the specific event (`task.status_changed`, `task.due_changed`, `task.comment_edited`, …). Residual `task.updated` fires only for leftover field keys (title, description, priority, parent, estimate, favorite, custom fields).

`task.moved` still fires when a task changes project or sprint. `task.project_changed` / `task.sprint_changed` fire in addition so relays can tell them apart.

Template tokens include `{task}` `{name}` `{status}` `{old_status}` `{project}` `{actor}` `{actor_id}` `{url}` `{id}` `{priority}` `{old_priority}` `{description}` `{parent_id}` `{estimate}` `{comment}` `{claimed_by}` `{due_date}` `{sprint}` `{tags}` `{mentions}` `{member}` `{join_email}` `{event}` `{event_id}` `{occurred_at}` `{changed}` `{fields}`.

For `http.webhook` with `format: json`, the body keeps those flat fields and adds nested `actor_detail`, `task_detail`, `project_detail`, `changes`, and `digest_events`. Outbound requests send `X-Ordryn-Event-Id` and, for queued rows, `X-Ordryn-Delivery-Id`. Failed deliveries become `dead` after 8 attempts; owners can `POST …/deliveries/{id}/retry`.

Status filters (`status_ids` / `status_exclude_ids`) work like tag filters. Quiet hours and digest (`hourly` / `daily`) still apply. Digest bodies list up to 10 `{name} ({event})` lines.

### Settings and fields

Setting widgets: `secret`, `bool`, `string`, `int`, `select` (requires `options`), `status`, `user`, `hook_select`, `priority`, `tag_ids`, `status_ids`, `status_exclude_ids`, `time`, `digest`, `field_filter`, `mention_map`, `project_ids`.

Custom field types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `enum`, `url`, `user`, `date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`), `markdown`.

### Sandboxed UI

Set `ui` to an HTML file in the folder. Project members see it in an iframe (`sandbox` without `allow-same-origin`, so it cannot read the session). Extra files next to that HTML are served under `/api/v2/projects/{id}/extensions/{id}/ui/…`. Do not put secrets in the panel; use outbound JSON callbacks instead. The **Standup** example is a working check-in worksheet in that iframe.

Host API 2 adds `surfaces` so a panel can also sit on the kanban board (`at: "kanban.tab"`). Those frames still cannot read the session. The parent SPA forwards `store.get` / `store.put` / `store.list` over `postMessage` to `GET`/`PUT /api/v2/projects/{id}/extensions/{id}/store/{key}` (64 KiB JSON, optimistic `revision`, SSE `extension.store`). Permissions: `store:read`, `store:write` (viewers are read-only). The **Retro** example is a Went well / Improve / Actions board keyed to the sprint switcher.

### Callback tokens and inbound actions

`permissions` (`tasks:read`, `tasks:write`, `comments:write`) mints a **project-scoped** callback token (not a user API key). JSON deliveries include it. Relays `POST /api/v2/ext/callback` with `Authorization: Bearer …` and `{ "action": "get"|"complete"|"comment"|"set_field", "task_id": 1, … }`. Rotate it from the project Extensions tab (`controls`: `rotate_callback`).

`actions` (`complete`, `comment`, `set_field`) opt the extension into extra inbound webhook verbs on `POST /api/v2/webhooks/inbound` when the extension is enabled on that project. First-party `create` / `comment` still use the project's inbound flags. JSON **must** include `project_id`. HMAC requests send `X-Ordryn-Timestamp` (unix seconds, ±5 minutes) and `X-Ordryn-Signature: sha256=HMAC(secret, timestamp + "." + body)`. Shared secret `X-Ordryn-Webhook-Secret` is unchanged. Both inbound and callback endpoints are rate-limited.

### Delivery

`delivery.type`: `discord.webhook`, `slack.webhook`, `teams.webhook`, `googlechat.webhook`, `ntfy.webhook`, `http.webhook`. `delivery.url_from` must be a `secret` setting key. Optional `format` for HTTP: `text`, `content`, or `json`. Optional HMAC signing via `controls`: `rotate_signing`.

## Requirements

- Go 1.24+
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (required for `/api/v2` auth, rate limits, device SSO, and live updates)
- Node.js + npm (to build or develop the Vue SPA)

## Quick start

One binary serves `/api/v2` and the Vue UI at `/` (or under `BASE_PATH`).

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # required; process will not start without it
npm run build:web      # writes web/dist; UI path is 503 without it
make run
```

Set `DB_*`, `SESSION_KEY`, and `REDIS_URL` in `.env`. Open http://localhost:8080/

`go run .` is fine too.

## Version

The git tag is the version. Nothing in source is bumped for a release.

- **GitHub Release:** Creating a release named `vX.Y.Z` (target `main`) creates the tag and is enough. CI stamps that tag into the attached server binaries. Those binaries do not need a `.git` directory.
- **Git checkout (`git pull` / `go run` / `make run`):** The process reports the latest tag reachable from HEAD. If you only pull production when you publish a tag, a host still on the `v3.22.0` commit shows `v3.22.0`; after you tag `v4.0.0` and pull that commit, it shows `v4.0.0`.
- **Changelog:** The in-app changelog only lists GitHub releases at or below that version, so `v3.22.0` will not show `v4.0.0` notes.
- **Forks:** The fork uses **its** tags, not new tags from upstream. A fork created at `v3.22.0` keeps reporting `v3.22.0` until you tag (or fetch tags) on that fork. Syncing `main` without tags can leave you with newer code still labeled as the old tag.
- **`"dev"`:** Fallback only when the checkout has no usable tag and the binary was not stamped. Fetch tags with `git fetch --tags` if a tagged checkout still shows `dev`.
